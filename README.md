# robot_exercise

A repo to investigate robotics data.

## Background

This particular robot processes tickets by taking an empty bowl from a pick up location (pass) and moving the bowl between different ingredient dispensers in turn according to the requested recipe.

Once all required ingredients in the ticket have been dispensed, the bowl is returned to the pass ...unless something has gone wrong. 

Note:

Each dispenser only dispenses one type of ingredient. Dispensers dispense ingredients one at a time. Dispensers are in fixed locations - only the bowl moves. 

## Aims

Part 1: Explore the dataset to get familiar with it

Part 2: Describe the dataset / summarise your initial findings 

Part 3: Extract some basic stats about the meals (tickets) made. 

    How many meals were made per day?  How many overall?
    What was the most popular ingredient?
    What was the most popular meal combination?
    How long did each meal take to make on average?
    Is there any relationship between ingredient and meal prep time? What about meal popularity and prep time? 


Part 4:  Is there anything else that can be extracted from this dataset that could shed some light on how the robot / parts of the robot are performing?  Visualisations and metrics welcome.
